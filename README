# inet.data

Inet.data is a library for modeling various Internet-related conceptual
entities as *data*, supporting applications with are *about* the modeled
entities versus *interfacing* with them.

## Installation

Inet.data is available on Clojars.  Add this `:dependency` to your Leiningen
`project.clj`:

```clj
[inet.data "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

Currently inet.data includes support for IP addresses and networks and for DNS
domain names.

### inet.data.ip

The `inet.data.ip` namespace defines types for addresses and networks.  All
public functions work in terms of a protocol which is also implemented for
strings, byte arrays, and `java.net.InetAddress`.

```clj
(require '[inet.data.ip :as ip])

(ip/network-contains? "192.168.1.0/24" "192.168.1.1") ;;=> true

(ip/address? "600d::") ;;=> true
(ip/address? "::bad::") ;;=> false

(let [rfc1918 (ip/network-set "10.0.0.0/8" "172.16.0.0/12" "192.168.0.0/16")]
  (get rfc1918 "10.31.33.7") ;;=> (#ip/network "10.0.0.0/8")
  (get rfc1918 "8.8.8.8") ;;=> nil
  )
```
